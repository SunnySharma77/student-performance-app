# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes student exam scores to uncover patterns in performance, understand correlations between study hours and marks, and make predictions using simple linear regression.  
It also demonstrates how to convert a data analysis project into a live web app using **Streamlit**.

## 🎯 Goals
- Calculate **Mean, Median, Mode** of student marks
- Find **correlation** between study hours and marks
- Identify **top 5% performers**
- Predict scores based on study hours (**Simple Linear Regression**)

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `student_performance_dataset.csv`  
Contains:
- `Name` – Student name  
- `Study Hours` – Number of hours studied per day  
- `Marks` – Marks scored out of 100
